=Section 1: What is Ecks?=

Ecks is a collection of bots and agents (collectively, Services) designed to make an IRC network easy to manage, maintain, and use. Ecks is being developed specifically for the GamesNET IRC Network, which is currently running a modified bahamut ircd and the latest stable version of Ecks.

Ecks acts as a daemon that links in to the IRC network as a server, and signs the bots and agents on as clients (usually opered). 

Ecks is highly configurable, but currently can provide channel, username, oper, help, and enforcement services.
