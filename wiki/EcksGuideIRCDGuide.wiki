=Section 3: Choosing an IRCd =

IRCds that are supported by Ecks:

|| IRCd name || Ecks Version || Ecks Module Name || Type of Support ||
|| Unreal || 0.4 || ecks.protocols.unreal32 || Full / Experimental ^1^||
|| Bahamut ^2^ || 0.3 || ecks.protocols.ngfqircd || Full ||
|| Scarlet || 0.4 || ecks.protocols.cots || Full || 

^1:^ Unreal support has not been tested very much, and assumes that the ircd hasn't been mucked around with much. The version of the protocol that is implemented is U2303.

^2:^ Bahamut is defaultly set up to remove umode +r from users when they change nicknames. We have this patched out of our version for obvious reasons. Everything should still work okay, except that users won't keep their +r through nickchanges. GamesNET uses specifically FQIRCD with the patch to fix +r. 

Your IRCd not listed here? Drop us a line, and we'll more than likely add support in the next version.
