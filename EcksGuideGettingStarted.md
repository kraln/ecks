# Section 2: Getting Started #

To get started using Ecks on your network, you'll need to make sure a few things work first, namely:
  * Java (1.5 or later)
  * Internet Connectivity

Download the latest distributable of Ecks, which should have a few different files in it:

| Ecks.jar | This is the main component of Ecks |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------|
| example\_ecks.xml | This is the example configuration file, you should probably start with this |
| register.txt | The file that gets sent when new users register |
| LICENSE.txt | The MPL, which Ecks is licensed under |
| AUTHORS.txt | The great people who brought you Ecks |
| easymail-1.0b.jar | Class providing email functionality in Ecks |
| xmlrpc-1.2-b1.jar | Class providing XML RPC functionality in Ecks |

You're probably going to want to use Ecks with an IRCd that Ecks supports. For more on that, see Section 3 (click next)
