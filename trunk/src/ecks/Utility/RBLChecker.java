    /*    http://relays.osirusoft.com/faq.html:
     For a given address, a.b.c.d will return one of the following values if a dns lookup of d.c.b.a.relays.osirusoft.com is performed.

     The DNS addressing is as follows:

     127.0.0.2 Verified Open Relay
     127.0.0.3 Dialup Spam Source
     Dialup Spam Sources are imported into the Zone file from other sources and some known sources are manually added to the local include file.
     127.0.0.4 Confirmed Spam Source
     A site has been identified as a constant source of spam, and is manually added. Submissions for this type of spam require multiple nominations from multiple sites. Test Blockers also find themselves in this catagory.
     127.0.0.5 Smart Host (In progress)
     A Smart host is a site determined to be secure, but relays for those who are not, defeating one level of security. When this is ready, it will be labeled outputs.osirusoft.com. NOTE: I strongly discourage using outputs due to it being way too effective to be useful.
     127.0.0.6 A Spamware software developer or spamvertized site. This information is maintained by spamsites.org and spamhaus.org.
     127.0.0.7 A list server that automatically opts users in without confirmation
     127.0.0.8 An insecure formmail.cgi script. (Planned)
     127.0.0.9 Open proxy servers
